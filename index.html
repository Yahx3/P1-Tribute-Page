        <h2>A Timeline outlining Key Events of Dr. Turing's Life</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1912 | June 23 | Birth of Alan Mathison Turing</li>
            <li>1925 | At age 14, Turing traveled 97 km on bicycle from his home in Southampton to ensure he attended his first day of school in Sherborne. </li>
            <li>1927 | At age 16, Turing began learning Albert Einstein's work and then extrapolated Einstein's questioning of Newton's law of motion, which was never explicity stated by Einstein</li>
            <li>1930 | A close friend, Christopher Morcom died from bovine tuberculosis. Turing renounced his religious faith and becomes an atheist.</li>
            <li>1931 | Turing enrolled in King's College, Cambridge to study mathematics.</li>
            <li>1935 | Turing proved the central limit theorem for his dissertation and is subsequently made a fellow at 22.</li>
            <li>1936 | Turing published his paper on Computable Number and an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem where he creates the Universal Machine. This is known today as the Turing Machine. It is a computing device able to solve and mathematical problem, that is represented as an algorithm.</li>
            <li>1936 | Turing begins studies in cryptology and mathematics under Alonzo Church at Princeton University.</li>
            <li>1938 | He received his PhD on his dissertation of 'Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals', introducing original logic and relative computing.</li>
            <li>1938 | Turing began working at the Government Code and Cypher School.</li>
            <li>1939 | In September, Turing begins working at Bletchley Park, working for Gordon Welchman developing the Bombe. The Bombe is a machine used to decrypt German messages send using the Engima machine. Turing applied statistical techniques to optimize trials.</li>
            <li>1942 | Turing goes to the United States as part of an intelligence collaboration; he inspects the encryption used between Churchill and Roosevelt. Turning dismisses the US cryptanalysis, based on the opinion that the US relies too heavily on machinery over thought.</li>
            <li>1943 | Turing and his colleagues broke the German Naval Enigma system.</li>
            <li>1945 | Turing is awarded an OBE for his work for the United Kingdom.</li>
            <li>1945 | Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory. He developed a computing machine known as the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine). He established a final complete proposal, but due to limited funding, the machine was not built.</li>
            <li>1947 | Turing returned to Cambridge on sabbatical. Here he built the first ACE.</li>
            <li>1949 | Turing took on the role of depute director at Computing Laboratory at Manchester University. He worked on software for an early stored program computer. He explored artificial intelligence, and defined a standard for machine intelligence. This was later known as the 'Turing test'. The idea is summarized as, the computer 'thinks' such that a human interrogator cannot tell it apart from a human during conversation. He also began developing the first chess program.</li>
            <li>1952 | Turing invited a newly acquainted man, Arnold Murray to his house. Murray spends the night at Turing's house numerous times. Later, Murray aids an accomplice in breaking and entering Turing's apartment, and stealing his belongings. Turing reports the crime and admits to having sexual relations with Murray, illegal at the time. Turing chooses to be chemically castrated to avoid imprisonment. His security clearance is removed, which removes him continuing to work for government projects.</li>
            <li>1954 | June 8 | Turing is found dead. He seems to poison himself using a cyanide-laced apple.</li>
